# Improving Smooth Control in Model-free RL

This repository contains part of the code developed by Juan Jose Garau Luis for his class project for MIT 6.884 Computational Sensorimotor Learning, in Spring 2021. The objective of this project was to explore and compare different strategies to reduce motion jerkiness in locomotion tasks using model-free RL. Part of the code has been implemented from [OpenAI's Spinning Up!](https://github.com/openai/spinningup).
